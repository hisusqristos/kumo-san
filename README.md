Crocheting may seem repetitive (tho it asctually is repetitive). You search for the patterns, watch tutorials, spend hours of repeating the same stitch over and over until you're finally done. (btw my mom wears my projects). </br>

Following someone else's patters can lead to losing hundreds of opportunities of having your own crochet adventures. In fact, there's something arithmetical about crocheting. Especially when there is an abstract shape to recreate. So i will document the patterns i discovered while making stuff then compare them with existing ways of making the same things. Have a nice day yall. </br>
